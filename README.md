## About Us

Studo is an EdTech startup based in Ghent, Belgium, founded in January 2025 by Charles Degraeuwe. We're on a mission to make studying more effective, accessible, and free for everyone.

## What We're Building

**Coming soon to:**

**Key features:**
- Flashcards with spaced repetition
- Interactive study modes
- Progress tracking & analytics
- Collaborative study sets
- And much more...

### Agenda App

We're also developing a dedicated agenda application designed specifically for students—helping you stay organized and on top of your academic schedule.

## Our Mission

We believe that quality study tools shouldn't come with a price tag. Our goal is to empower students worldwide with free, powerful software that helps them achieve their academic goals.
